# Welcome to the Flip ðŸŽ²  Documentation

This `README` will walk you through navigating the Flip documentation.

Flip is Fast, Lightweight pure-functional library for Information theory and Probability distribution. Flip aims to extract and process statistical features of the input data stream in a short time using only small memory. Especially, it is essential that Flip estimates and summarizes the density of the data stream. By statistical processing using the estimated and summarized probability distribution, various statistical features can be handled with fewer resources.
 
Flip can be used to accurately estimate the probability density, regardless of what characteristics a random variable stream follows. The followings are some selected examples: a bimodal distribution, a pareto with long tail, a incremental concept drift that changes its statistical properties incrementally, and a sudden concept drift.
